<h3>dogs</h3>
<p>A third of ALL households around the world have a dog.These playful, friendly, loyal animals make great companions, but they can also be fierce and tough protectors, or intelligent helpers.</p>
<p>Dogs were the first animal domesticated (tamed) by humans, over 20,000 years ago! As they evolved from wolves, their skulls, teeth and paws shrank, and they became more docile and obedient.</p>
